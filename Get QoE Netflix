Netflix Video QoE Capture Script

This Python script captures on-screen debug information (such as VMAF, bitrate, and throughput) displayed during video playback (e.g., Netflix) and logs it automatically to a text file.

What It Does

- Takes periodic screenshots of a defined region on your screen
- Uses OCR (Tesseract) to extract text data (e.g., video quality metrics)
- Filters key fields (VMAF, bitrate, buffer, dropped frames, throughput)
- Appends them to a timestamped log file

Requirements

- macOS
- Python 3.8+
- PyCharm IDE (or any Python environment)
Python Packages

Install with pip:
```bash
pip install pytesseract pillow
Tesseract OCR
Install Tesseract (required for OCR):

brew install tesseract
If not using Homebrew, you can download Tesseract manually from:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki

After install, verify it works:
which tesseract
Add this line to your Python script if needed:
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = "/opt/homebrew/bin/tesseract"

How to Use
Open the Netflix (or any video) debug overlay on your Mac screen.


Adjust the region variable in the script to match the coordinates where the debug text appears:
region = (left, top, right, bottom)
Run the script:
python screen_qoe_capture.py
The script will log entries every 4 seconds to:
