This tool extracts Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics from Netflix debug logs using objective video quality data like VMAF, bitrate, buffer levels, and throughput. It implements a variant of the QoE model used in SIGCOMM 2015. (https://doi.org/10.1145/2785956.2787486)
Features
Parses raw Netflix playback logs or debug text dumps

Computes raw QoE using VMAF, bitrate variation, rebuffering, and startup delay

Normalizes QoE into a 1–100 scale using a logistic sigmoid function

Outputs results as a structured CSV
Background
Netflix does not provide direct API access to raw QoE stats. However, it does expose detailed stats in a debug overlay that includes:

Video resolution and codec

Bitrate and throughput

Playback buffer

VMAF (video quality)

Dropped/corrupted frames

You can extract this overlay by pressing:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Control + Shift + Option + D   (Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + Alt + D         (Windows)
This tool is designed to process those logs.
Input Format
Provide a plain text file (.txt) containing one or more Netflix debug output blocks like this:

txt
Copy
Edit
Playing bitrate (a/v): 128 / 1961
Playing/Buffering vmaf: 95/95
Buffer size in Seconds (a/v): 228.695 / 229.002
Throughput: 74882 kbps
Total Dropped Frames: 0
Each block should start with a line like MovieId: to mark a new session.

QoE Formula
This script uses a simplified version of the SIGCOMM 2015 model:

makefile
Copy
Edit
QoE_raw = VMAF 
          - λ × quality_variation 
          - μ × rebuffer_penalty 
          - μs × startup_delay
Then:

ini
Copy
Edit
QoE_normalized = 1 + 99 / (1 + exp(-0.01 * (QoE_raw - 500)))
You can modify penalty weights (λ, μ, μs) as needed.
